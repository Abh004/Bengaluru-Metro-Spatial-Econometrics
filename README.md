# Bengaluru-Metro-Spatial-Econometrics
This repository presents an Advanced Spatial Econometrics and Geospatial Modeling framework for analyzing the socio-economic and urban spatial impacts of the Bengaluru Metro (Namma Metro) rail system.

The project utilizes sophisticated spatial statistical techniques:
- Spatial Autoregressive Models (SAR)
- Spatial Error Models (SEM)
- Hedonic Price Models)
- Data processing and visualization.

## Objective
To quantify the causal and spatial spillover effects of metro station proximity and network topology on key urban indicators, such as property prices, and land-use change within the Bengaluru Metropolitan Region.

## Methodology
Implementation of spatial econometric models in Python (using libraries like PySAL, geopandas, scikit-learn)
